# Lantern

Version 0.1.0

Will be a JavaScript library for illuminating memory issues in Chrome.

Getting started now building out project structure.

## Usage

The demo directory shows how to use lantern.js directly and with requirejs.

## Project scripts

* `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `dist` directory
* `npm run build-demo` - bower installs lantern.js in the requirejs and vanillajs demos
* `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `npm run test` - runs mocha tests
